Module 4 - Pandas Challenge  

Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your local government area. In this capacity, you'll be helping the schoolboard and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. You'll be given access toevery student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task isto aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.  

Local Government Area (LGA) Summary  
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the local government area's keymetrics. Include the following:  
Total number of unique schools  
Total students  
Total budget  
Average maths score  
Average reading score  
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)  
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)  
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)  
Note: A passing grade is 50 or higher.  

School Summary  
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school. Include the following:  
School name  
School type  
Total students  
Total school budget  
Per student budget  
Average maths score  
Average reading score  
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)  
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)  
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)    

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)  
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.    

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing).   
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.    

Maths Scores by Year  
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average maths score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.  

Reading Scores by Year  
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.  

Scores by School Spending  
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).  

Scores by School Size  
Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small,medium, or large).  

Scores by School Type  
This DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".
